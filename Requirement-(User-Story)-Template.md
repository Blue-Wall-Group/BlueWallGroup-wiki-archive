Priority will be indicated by order in Product Backlog.  
Any optional fields can be safely deleted with their headings.  
Phabricator links are only required when a Phabricator issue is used for the user story.  
User story writing protocol may be subject to slight changes due to style preference.  
A user story expression should also appear as the user story title in CA Agile.  
User story titles in CA Agile have a character limit of 256 and may need to be cut off.  
Estimated story points consist of Fibonacci-like numbers, such as: 1, 3, 5, 8, etc.  
Estimated times to develop may be in terms of sprint-lengths when avoiding actual intervals.

CA Agile Color Code (under consideration):  
Blue: represents an issue from Phabricator which has seen next to no debate over its relevance or method of implementation.  
    In a nutshell: "the cooled and calm issue that few have disagreed with, blue like a peaceful lake"  

Dark Blue: represents an issue from Phabricator which has seen no discussion over it for over a year since its posting. Like Blue stories, this one represents issues with very little or no debate but haven't sparked any discussion for quite some time.  
    In a nutshell: "the cold and almost dead issue that many have forgotten, dark blue like a deep sea"  

Green: represents an issue which has only been on the tracker for a number of days, with or without much discussion about it. This may even constitute stories which we think of but aren't necessarily taken from Phabricator at all.  
    In a nutshell: "the fresh and mostly untested issue that may or may not come from the MediaWiki community, green like a new sprout or sapling"  

Purple: represents an issue which has seen meaningful developments on the ticket already, such as an open project or claimed development. These user stories may have been added to our backlog as practice with working on issues of its type.  
    In a nutshell: "the pre-developed and already handled issue that we may want to practice or consider removing, purple like a well-seasoned and marinated hunk of meat ready to cook"  

Pink: represents an issue which we have been developing since a previous sprint, currently in active development by this team. Change of color code to Pink should occur during development upon a story of this type and should persist when we decide to make a copy of the story into the backlog for next sprint.  
    In a nutshell: "the currently in development by this team and intended to be completed before acceptance type of story, pink like a raw slab of pork before it's truly been flavored for barbeque"  

Burnt Orange: represents an issue which still has rather heated debate over either its relevance or implementation, despite having been posted more than a year ago. New comments on such issues may have been made up to a week before. These should likely have no existing development on the tracker.  
    In a nutshell: "the hotly debated yet old issue that nobody seems to want to let go of or start a project for, dark orange like a recently burning campfire or barbeque pit just letting its embers smolder without flames"  

Orange: represents an issue like those classified as Burnt Orange but much more recently posted. It likely has just as hotly debated concerns with just as little development actually occurring, but its recency is what sets it apart.  
    In a nutshell: "the hotly debated yet new issue that nobody seems to agree upon implementation or relevance for, orange like the flames of a newly lit barbeque or forge ready to work"  

Yellow: represents an issue which lacks well-defined requirements or specifications. These could either use some additional research into what causes the issue or additional questioning in the open ticket. Largely, this should constitute some fascinating issues no matter the length of time they've been inactive.  
    In a nutshell: "the vague or mysterious issue that seems interesting but lacks adequate details on the surface, yellow like a traffic light telling drivers to slow down before they're told to stop"  

Grey: represents an issue which has, like purple, either been taken by another team or shows signs of active development unrelated to our team... yet doesn't seem like a good fit to us for even practice or hasn't had a relevant update in years. These stories are likely deprecated in all but official terms and should likely be removed from our backlog.  
    In a nutshell: "the truly dead or already taken issues that don't need our additional attention but need removal approval, grey like used charcoal and just as difficult to relight without additional fuel"
