Sprint -: 3/2/2018 to 3/9/2018, 9 Points, - estimated hours.

## Roles
Scrum Master: Jaziel Pauda

Product Owner: Hunter Hobbs

## Planning

### Goals
Focus on making a deliverable enhancement to Gerrit for review and possible acceptance. As a team, we would like to accomplish having two commits merged.

### User Stories
- As a maintainer, I would like Issue T161612 patch set 5 to output button text per reviewer comments on Gerrit so that this patch follows MW organizational standards.  
- As a MediaWiki user with accessibility needs, I want properly ordered headings tags so that they can be meaningfully interpreted by my Screen Readers.  
- As a team member, I want to know more about US62 so that we may begin to design a new patch for this issue.

### Key decisions  
- Jaziel facilitated Planning Poker (as Scrum Master) to decide story point estimation.  
- Focus on merging two patches this sprint.
