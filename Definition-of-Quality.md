# Overview 
For this project we define product quality distinctly from process quality.  Both will be tracked as each Sprint progresses.  

The following is a list of behavior and accomplishments which we feel will result in a quality product/process.  Associated with each item is a rationale for its inclusion as well as our method for measuring its degree of success per Sprint.
