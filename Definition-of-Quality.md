# Overview 
For this project we define product quality distinctly from process quality.  Both will be tracked as each Sprint progresses.  

The following is a list of behavior and accomplishments which we feel will result in a quality product/process.  Associated with each item is a rationale for its inclusion as well as our method for measuring its degree of success per Sprint.

# Process Quality
* Stand-Ups 
    * Definition: Daily (in our case nightly) concise meeting wherein all team members briefly answer three 
                  questions that keep the team collectively informed on individual team members' commitments.<br/>
                  Questions:  
                      - What did you do today?  
                      - What will you do tomorrow?  
                      - Are there any impediments in your way?

# Product Quality
* Meet coding standards for MW 
    * Definition:All code produced by the team must meet all code standards defined by the MediaWiki, and the MediaWiki 
                 Accessibility sub-project. Links to coding standards can be found under the "Standards" section of the 
                 "home" page of the Wiki.
    * Rationale: All MediaWiki contributors are expected to adhere to conventions established by the project in order to 
                 maintain the quality and maintainability of the code base.
    * Measurement: No patches submitted by the team during the current sprint get rejected because of violations to the 
                   coding standards.
