# Overview 
For this project we define product quality distinctly from process quality.  Both will be tracked as each Sprint progresses.  

The following is a list of behavior and accomplishments which we feel will result in a quality product/process.  Associated with each item is a rationale for its inclusion as well as our method for measuring its degree of success per Sprint.

# Process Quality
* Stand-Ups 
    * Definition: 
                  Daily (in our case nightly) concise meeting wherein all team members briefly answer three 
                  questions that keep the team collectively informed on individual team members' commitments.<br/>
                  Questions: 
                      - What did you do today?  
                      - What will you do tomorrow?  
                      - Are there any impediments in your way?
