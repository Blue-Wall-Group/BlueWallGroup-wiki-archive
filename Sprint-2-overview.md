### Was our goal met?
Yes, as all team members have obtained some level of experience working directly on the MediaWiki project.

## Retrospective

### What went well
Documentation, familiarity with CA Agile, and task creation have all improved.  Communication with the existing MediaWiki team has also been fruitful

### What to improve on
We need to make better use of the time between Thursday and Tuesday, as well as "outside of class" time in general.  Additionally, we need to start scoping the issues we bring into each sprint more realistically. 

### Key decisions

***

### Key Decisions

- More detailed information will be tracked for each sprint on the wiki (see Jesse's template)
- Presentations may/should cover information outside of progress (e.g. Accessibility).
- Collective agreement to utilize Thursday-Tuesday time more effectively.
- Issues will be accepted only after a satisfying walkthrough with two other team members who did not directly work on the item.
- Use CA Agile's "split" option on unfinished user stories.
