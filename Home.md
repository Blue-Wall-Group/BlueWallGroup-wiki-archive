## **Vision Statement**  
To transition from students into professional software developers with knowledge and experience with respect to open-source projects, agile practices, and collaboration with large external teams. 

## **Mission Statement**
Contribute to the MediaWiki Accessibility project in a way that enhances the accessibility of MediaWiki for its large user base; while utilizing industry standard project management and version control tools, processes, and best practices.

## **Stakeholders & Objectives**
**The team:**  
**Individual team members:**  
**Dr. Jody Paul:**  
**Future contributors joining the project:**  
**MediaWiki users with accessibility needs:**  
**MediaWiki average users:**  
**MediaWiki developers & maintainers:**


## **Team Organization**
**Software Development Life-cycle Model:** *Scrum Agile*  
  
We practice the Scrum Agile methodology by focusing on the following principles:
 
* Weekly sprints
* Iterative requirements engineering
* Daily stand-up meetings
* Constant communication with stakeholders
* Designated Scrum Master (rotating each sprint)
* Designated Product Owner (rotating each sprint)
* Always have a working deliverable

 
### **Team Communication:**  

We have daily stand-up meetings (Monday - Friday) where each team member takes two minutes to discuss what they are working on, what's blocking progress, and what they plan to do next.  

We use Slack for internal communication: bluewallgroup.slack.com

Communication with the MediaWiki development community happens in several different ways: MediaWiki Accessibility subproject uses [Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/profile/171/) to publish known issues and defects on the MediaWiki Accessibility [workboard](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/board/171/). General development questions should be posted to [MediaWiki Discourse page](https://discourse-mediawiki.wmflabs.org/c/ask-here). There is also a MediaWiki IRC. More information on the IRC channels can be found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_on_IRC).

## **Onboarding Information**


**Project Information**
CA Agile Central will be utilized as the project management tool, and provide project metrics.
CA Agile Central can be found <a href="https://rally1.rallydev.com">here</a>.

Issues will be collected, and external developers will be contacted via the <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/profile/171/">MediaWiki Accessibility Project</a>.

CA Agile Central workflow:
Current sprint status can be found on the "Iteration status page". The iteration status page contains the user stories the team is currently working on, as well effort estimation for each user story, in points for user stories, and hours needed to complete for sub-tasks for each user story. This page also contains metrics for the current sprint.
The product backlog can be found in the "Backlog" page. This page contains all backlog items (user stories and defects) prioritized by list order. All backlog items that currently have tasks can also be viewed on this page by expanding the item. 

**Standards:**
The group will uphold certain standards during development. These standards are mostly developed by MediaWiki to ensure all contributors provide high quality code, and conform to specific accessibility requirements. Links to the standards can be found below:
