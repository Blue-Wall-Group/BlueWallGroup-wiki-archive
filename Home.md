## Vision Statement 
To transition from students into professional software developers with knowledge and experience with respect to open-source projects, agile practices, and collaboration with large external teams. 

## Mission Statement
Contribute to the MediaWiki Accessibility project in a way that enhances the accessibility of MediaWiki for its large user base; while utilizing industry standard project management and version control tools, processes, and best practices.

## Stakeholders & Objectives
**The team:** To grow in effectiveness and familiarity in software engineering processes and practices.  

**Individual team members:**  Transition from students to professional software engineers. And contribute the community of an HFOSS project in a positive way.  
  
**Dr. Jody Paul:** \<PROBABLY ABOUT PROCESS AND QUALITY ASK HIM AND FINALIZE THIS\>    

**Future contributors joining the project:** Obtain a project that includes quality documentation and onboarding materials that make it easy to join the project and start contributing quickly.  
  
**MediaWiki users with accessibility needs:** Receive a product with multiple enhancements that make all of its features more accessible to ALL users.  
  
**MediaWiki average users:** Receive a stable product that is not affected by bug fixes/enhancements.  
  
**MediaWiki developers & maintainers:** Receive contributions that meet coding standards, behave correctly, and that can be integrated into the existing project.  

## Current Product Deliverable
Our product deliverable can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Blue-Wall-Group/mediawiki/wiki/Product-Deliverable).

## Team Organization
**Software Development Life-cycle Model:** *Scrum Agile*  
  
We practice the Scrum Agile methodology by focusing on the following principles:
 
* Weekly sprints
* Iterative requirements engineering
* Daily stand-up meetings
* Constant communication with stakeholders
* Designated Scrum Master (rotating each sprint)
* Designated Product Owner (rotating each sprint)
* Always have a deliverable product.

 
### Team Communication:  

We have daily stand-up meetings (Monday - Friday) where each team member takes two minutes to discuss what they are working on, what's blocking progress, and what they plan to do next.  

We use Slack for internal communication: bluewallgroup.slack.com

Communication with the MediaWiki development community happens in several different ways: MediaWiki Accessibility subproject uses [Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/profile/171/) to publish known issues and defects on the MediaWiki Accessibility [workboard](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/board/171/). General development questions should be posted to [MediaWiki Discourse page](https://discourse-mediawiki.wmflabs.org/c/ask-here). There is also a MediaWiki IRC. More information on the IRC channels can be found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_on_IRC).

## Onboarding Information

**If you are new or unfamiliar with the project, you will want to familiarize yourself with several items:**  

1. The Blue Wall Group's team contribution and collaboration information can be found [here](https://github.com/Blue-Wall-Group/mediawiki/wiki/Contribution-and-Collaboration-Guide).  

2. General information about the MediaWiki software and project overview can be found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Accessibility_guide_for_developers). 

3. To learn more about accessibility, a guide for developers can be found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Accessibility_guide_for_developers).  

4. New contributors to the project can learn about setting up an MW development environment [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_become_a_MediaWiki_hacker#Set_up_your_development_environment).  

5. MediaWiki uses Git -> Git-Review -> Gerrit for code patch submission, review and merge requests. A tutorial on the MediaWiki code review workflow can be found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial).  

6. A useful pre-Gerrit commit checklist can be found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pre-commit_checklist).  

7. MediaWiki PHP coding conventions are found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/PHP).  

8. MediaWiki JavaScript coding conventions are found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/JavaScript).

## Current Project Notebook
Our current project notebook deliverable can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1baHyOGht59idnjHXMYV0NcmQINM07uiD6Qdk35cKNlM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Project Management

The Blue Wall Group uses CA Agile Central (previously known as *Rally*) for project management. You can access this [here](https://rally1.rallydev.com).   

Our product backlog can be found on the ***backlog*** page and our current sprint can be found on the ***Iteration Status*** page. 

**CA Agile Central workflow:** 
 
The ***backlog*** page contains a list of all backlog items (user stories and defects) prioritized by list order. All backlog items that currently have associated tasks can also be viewed on this page by expanding the item. CA Agile Central tracks progress and provides a way for us to compare our planned effort to our actual effort spent.  

The ***Iteration Status*** page contains the user stories the team is currently working on, as well effort estimation for each user story, in points for user stories, and hours needed to complete for sub-tasks for each user story. This page also contains metrics for the current sprint.

## Quality Assessment

Quality vehicles, assessment workflow and metric information can be found [here](https://github.com/Blue-Wall-Group/mediawiki/wiki/Definition-of-Quality).

## Current Sprint Information

We are not currently in a sprint, but will resume normal development on 4/06/18.
